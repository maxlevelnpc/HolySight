![holy_sight_tray](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd3e5857-3ea3-44b8-864e-b96772fcd642)

HolySight doesn't use a traditional window â€” everything is configured directly from the system tray menu.
When you launch the app, a new icon will appear in your system tray (bottom-right of your screen).

- Right-click the system tray icon to open the menu.
- Use sliders to adjust size, opacity, and border thickness.
- Click the buttons to change:
  - Crosshair color
  - Border color
  - Enable/disable move mode
- Select **"Set image"** to load a custom PNG/JPG.
- Click **"Reset"** to restore the default red dot.
- Use **"Hide"/"Show"** to toggle visibility.
- Choose **"Exit"** to close the app.

To disable or exit Move Mode, press **Enter**, **Escape**, or click the button again (tooltip changes to **"Exit move mode"**).
While in Move Mode, you can also **double-click the crosshair** to instantly center it on the screen.
